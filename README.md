# youtube-clone

Youtube Clone project is in ReactJS, Axios.js, Lodash.js. It uses Youtube API in order to fetch videos and display to the users. Here you can search for any videos you want to watch. This mini project doesnâ€™t have features like the real youtube which contains like and dislikes, comments, subscription, etc. This simple ReactJS application only lets you surf videos online, read descriptions and it is pretty responsive. It contains a search bar which displays various results searched by the users. Not only the searched video but also it displays related videos too.
